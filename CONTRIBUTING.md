## Static content

Static content is maintained by the Leading Advisors for software development.

There are two types of static content; _theme pages_ and _documents_.

### Theme Page

A theme page contains a description about a theme (e.g. _API_, _Open Source_, _Software Security_, etc) and set of
links to documents covering the theme. The links are collected by matching the tags in the theme page with the tags of the documents.
E.g. a theme page with the tag `API` will contains links to all pages tagged with `API`.

Template:

```
---
title: TITLE
tags: ['TAG 1']
---

Write your theme description here...
```

### Document

Documents are placed in `index.md` in a separate directories under `/content/docs`.

Template:

```
---
title: TITLE
tags:
  - TAG 1
  - TAG 2
---

Write your document content here...
```

### Tags
Tags on all content is optional. If no tag is set, the document will automatically be listed in a separate Miscellaneous theme page with a general icon. 
Documents with multiple tags will be listed under multiple theme pages. We encourage writers to be selective in choosing tags.
